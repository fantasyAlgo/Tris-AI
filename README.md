# Tris-AI
Little nxn tris in python/c++
To run it, run the main.py file, then it will ask 
1. the size of the window (800 should work ok)
2. The size of the board
3. Difficulty of the AI (It actually the depth parameter of the minimax algorithm, 2 and 3 become too heavy for 4x4 and so on)
4. <br>
**Note**
It is not written but if you want you can change the number of piece to check with the parameter pieceToCheck that is automatically set to the size of the board
